You work for an airline, and you've been tasked with improving the procedure for reserving and buying seats.  
You have the table  **seats**, which describes seats in the airplane. It has the following columns:

-   `seat_no`  - The unique number of the seat;
-   `status`  - The status of the seat (`0`  indicates  _free_,  `1`  indicates  _reserved_, and  `2`  indicates  _purchased_);
-   `person_id`  - The ID of the person who reserved/purchased this seat (`0`  if the corresponding  `status`  is  `0`).

You also have the table  **requests**, which contains the following columns:

-   `request_id`  - The unique ID of the request;
-   `request`  - The description of the request (`1`  indicates  _reserve_,  `2`  indicates  _purchase_);
-   `seat_no`  - The number of the seat that the person want to reserve/purchase;
-   `person_id`  - The ID of the person who wants to reserve/purchase this seat.

A person can reserve/purchase a free seat and can purchase a seat that they have reserved.

Your task is to return the table  **seats**  after the given requests have been performed.

_Note:_  requests are applied from the lowest  `request_id`; it's guaranteed that all values of  `seat_no`  in the table  **requests**  are presented in the table  **seats**.

Example

For the given tables  **seats**

| seat_no | status | person_id |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| 1       | 1      | 1         |
| 2       | 1      | 2         |
| 3       | 0      | 0         |
| 4       | 2      | 3         |
| 5       | 0      | 0         |

and  **requests**

| request_id | request | seat_no | person_id |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| 1          | 1       | 3       | 4         |
| 2          | 2       | 2       | 5         |
| 3          | 2       | 1       | 1         |

the output should be

| seat_no | status | person_id |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| 1       | 2      | 1         |
| 2       | 1      | 2         |
| 3       | 1      | 4         |
| 4       | 2      | 3         |
| 5       | 0      | 0         |

The first request is completed because seat number  `3`  is free. The second request is ignored because seat number  `2`  is already reserved by another person. The third request is completed because seat number  `1`  was reserved by this person, so they can purchase it.
